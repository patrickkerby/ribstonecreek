# ribstonecreek
*Phase 1:*
- Home page 
- Updates (page we can update with news of awards, beer launches, events at the brewery, new merch, etc.) 
- Beer (includes descriptions of each beer [Main line-up, seasonals, exclusives and retired] 
- About (includes story of the brewery, taproom images) 
- Contact us 

*Phase 2:*
- Online Store 
- Specific "Where to buy beer" contact form 
- "Visit Us" page: Offerings about taproom, event hosting, party hosting (stags, birthdays, etc.) 

*Next Steps:*
- Moving to a new server: Can you assist us with this and provide recommendations and guidance? 
- Timelines: Can you provide us with timelines? Maybe for phase 1 and then phase 2? 
- Content: We understand we will provide the content. What is the best way to get the content to you or to organize the content to be uploaded. Any suggestions would be appreciated. 
- If we buy ribstone.ca and ribstonecreek.ca just to own it, could we have it easily forwarded to the new page as well? ribstone.com is for sale...for a cool $2,100....
